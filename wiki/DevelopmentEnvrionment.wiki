= Introduction =

This application is written in Java and is targeted for the Android Operating System.  The target Android OS is 2.1, however, there are no Android 2.1 specific dependencies and the application will run on Android 1.5 and greater.

This application utilizes libraries from the Spring Framework <http://www.springframework.org>.  Two such components are the Spring Mobile and Spring Android projects.

== Requirements ==

These are the requirements for building and running the application in the Android Emulator.

  # *JDK*: Java JDK 1.5 or later

  # *Dependency Management*: Maven2 is used to manage all third-party libraries, building, etc. <http://maven.apache.org/>
  # *Source Control*: Subversion

Optional Requirements
  # *IDE*: Eclipse-based IDE
    * I prefer the SpringSource Tool Suite, free Eclipse-based IDE targeted for use with the Spring Framework <http://www.springframework.org>
